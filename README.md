# Open Portal Platform (OPP)

A system whereby the entire platform auto-deploys on a regular basis and is powered by contributers and content providers.  
The viewers/consumers of the content will pay for the content (either directly or indirectly) and the beneficiaries will be
those who contribute to the platform.  It will be a meritocracy whereby those who contribute to the software engineering will
benefit for their regular improvements to the platform and maintaining of it and the content creators will benefit in a way
that is measured by their overall impact on revenues. Most companies require very formal and rigorous structures to build and 
a software platform.  The idea is to create a completely community owned and maintained platform that is relatively decentralized
and at the same time based on merit rather that internal politics.  It also allows for people to be located anywhere in the world 
with an internet connection that are able to contribute to the project.

## Benefitting as a content provider
- Profiting as a content provider will depend on how much that content provider is able to generate profits directly from the consumer.
  For example, in the case of E-Learning content, each user that pays for a monthly subscription will contribute to the overall revenues
  of the platform.  Therefore, that additional user's revenues were thanks to a `contributer A`.  Therefore, the overall increase should
  be rewarded some fair amount (say 50%) to `contributer A` and the rest to the overall bucket which is then further divided up with the 
  maintainers of the site, hosting costs, etc.
  
## Benefitting as a software developer
- Usually in any software engineering project, additional features need to be built as well as old bugs and problems solved.  We will refer
  to both the new features and bug fixes together as engineering contributions.  For each of these engineering contributions, we will
  need to measure the overall impact of these bugs to the platform as a whole.  Of course, we need to properly incentivate engineers
  to aim for overall stability of the platform as well as aggressive new features that are able to further the interests of the community
  as a whole.  One way of measuring each engineering contribution in terms of impact, and therefore financial worth, would be to have 
  a regular voting session whereby the overall impact of a given ticket is voted on by the community of developers.  This is similar to 
  the agile process where people play a card game to measure the story points of each given story.  We can make it openly votable by all
  active contributers of the engineering team, without regard to "seniority" based on vertical position.  At the end of the month, after
  customer revenues (and/or other revenues) are received, we evenly distribute the profits among the contributers for that month based on
  their story points and the impact of those points to the platform for that time period.
  


## Proposed profit sharing
1. Money comes in (either via customer memberships, advertising, sales, etc). as revenues.
2. The initial costs are paid for (accounting fees, hosting fees, any licenses and fixed costs such as rent).  All these costs will be
   made public to everyone.
3. The remaining money is then put into a pool and divided up amongst the contributers and the founder(s).  
   - The founders will receive a fixed 25% for creating and maintaining the overall structure and integrity of the community as a whole.
   - The software developers will receive 25% and the content providers will receive 25%, and that percentage will be further divided
     amongst them based on contribution.
   - The remaining 25% will go into a safety net and will continue to accumulate for any future needs (such as IPO).
